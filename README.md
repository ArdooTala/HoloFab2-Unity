# [HoloFab2](https://holofab.github.io/)

This is the new structure for Unity side of Holofab.

It has two branches:
- hololens
- arcore

New structure relies on submodules that are joint between parts of project into separate repos.

Developed by (in alphabetical order):

- Akbari Armin
- Koshelyuk Daniil
- Talaei Ardeshir

Special thanks to [IAAC](https://iaac.net/), where the project originated as part of our individual thesis and research projects.
